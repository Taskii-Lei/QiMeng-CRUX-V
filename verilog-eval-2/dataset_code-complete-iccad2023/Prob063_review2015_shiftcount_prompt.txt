Build a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter where data is shifted in most-significant-bit first when shift_ena is 1 and the number currently in the shift register is decremented when count_ena is 1, with no requirement specified for the circuit's behavior when both shift_ena and count_ena are 1 as they are never used together.

module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input shift_ena,
  input count_ena,
  input data,
  output reg [3:0] q
);
